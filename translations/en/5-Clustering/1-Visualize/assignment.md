# Research other visualizations for clustering

## Instructions

In this lesson, you've explored some visualization techniques to help you prepare your data for clustering. Scatterplots, in particular, are effective for identifying groups of objects. Investigate alternative methods and libraries for creating scatterplots, and document your findings in a notebook. You can use the data provided in this lesson, data from other lessons, or data you source independently (make sure to credit the source in your notebook). Create scatterplots with the data and explain your observations.
