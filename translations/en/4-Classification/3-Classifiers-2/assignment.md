# Parameter Play

## Instructions

There are many parameters that are set by default when working with these classifiers. Intellisense in VS Code can help you explore them. Choose one of the ML Classification Techniques covered in this lesson and retrain models by adjusting various parameter values. Create a notebook that explains why certain changes improve the model's quality while others worsen it. Provide a detailed explanation in your response.
